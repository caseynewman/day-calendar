# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This calendar was created so that the user can have a simple work day scheduler where they can add and save daily to-do's. The scheduler is responsive with the current date and time, so the user can clearly see past events, what's happening currently, and future events. In building this project, I learned how to implement third party APIs like dayjs. I used loops to change the background color for each time block dynamically, as well as to save and retrieve each event in local storage.
