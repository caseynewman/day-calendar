# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This calendar was created so that the user can have a simple work day scheduler where they can add and save daily to-do's. The scheduler is responsive with the current date and time, and it displays color-coded time blocks so the user can clearly see past events, what's happening currently, and future events. In building this project, I learned how to implement third party APIs like dayjs. I used loops to change the background color for each time block dynamically, as well as to save and retrieve each event in local storage.

## Usage

Click into a text area to add an event or to-do for that time slot. Click the save button to store your task. When you refresh your browser, your event will still be saved in the appropriate time block. When you'd like to clear a task, simply delete your text and hit save.

## Credits

Our instructor, CJ Jordan, held office hours that clarified questions I had about local storage.
